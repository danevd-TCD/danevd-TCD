My name is Daniel Danev, and this is my GitHub. I'm currently in the final stretch of my [MSc Computer Science (Conversion)](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=T195) degree from University College Dublin. I previously graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a degree in Engineering with Management.
